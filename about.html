<div class="about-text">
    <div class="texttext">
        Growing up in the heart of the Silicon Valley, I’ve always admired those kids in class that were able to give powerpoint lectures their undivided attention, skip a level in math, ace their standardized tests, then get admitted early into their dream university. 
<br>
<br>
        I was never one of them; but, I felt pressured to run and win in the same race as them, sometimes (okay, a lot of the times). However, I stood unfazed in my dream to be a designer. 
        <br>
        <br>

        So, I paid my dues in the academic world, and soon enough I found myself seated as a graphic design and architecture major at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. 
<br>
<br>

        It only took a semester for me to learn that it wasn’t the place for me to be at 18 years old. 
        <br>
        <br>

        It felt like the only thing I was learning was that there has to be more to design.
        <br>
        <br>

        As cheesy as this sounds:
        <br>
        <br>

            I thought college was the best and only way for me to become a 	designer; it wasn’t.
            <br>
            <br>

            I thought I knew myself; I didn’t.
            <br>
            <br>

        I couldn’t continue to burn thousands of dollars on an education that I no longer believed in, so I took a leap out of the box and embarked in redesigning my life. 
        <br>
        <br>

        For the next couple of years I embarked on throwing myself around the world in order to expand my worldview. I immersed myself in learning about life, love, culture, the analog society, and my identity. 
        <br>
        <br>

        Once I felt full with life, I took what I saw in the tangible world, combined it with my experiences, and was able to redefine my passion for design. 
        <br>
        <br>

        If there’s one power couple in the world, it’s design and technology.
        <br>
        <br>

        I delved back into academia and sat in a room full of engineers and programmers to learn not only code and how to communicate with that side of the industry, but also to dive deeper as a visual designer.
        <br>
        <br>

        With background in 2D/3D design, and now programming, I  take a 
        polymathic approach to design in technology.
