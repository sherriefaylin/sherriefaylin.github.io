            <p class="par">Hey!</p>

            <p class="par">My name is Sherrie and here’s my TLDR:</p>
                    
            <p class="par">I started out as a Visual Communication Design + Architecture double major at School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
                    
                    <p class="par">A couple semesters in, I reluctantly had to admit that I was craving for more (learning? experiences? life? Who knew at the time…) and SAIC just wasn’t for me anymore.</p>
                    
                    <p class="par">So I left, embarking on a crazy, one-and-a-half year long trip around the world. </p>
                    
                    <p class="par">That’s a story for another day, but here I am back at home again, doing this. </p>
                    
                    <p class="par">;)</p>
