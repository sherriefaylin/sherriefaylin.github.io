<!-- for some reason the <footer> element would flow
around the section/aside elements even though it's
not a part of it. I tried to move it before and after the div,
and it would be fine if it came right after <nav> but not
after. Tested by keeping css consistent, only moving location
of <footer> in html, so no conclusion as to why this happens.
Temporary fix by giving element width in css. -->
