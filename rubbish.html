            <p class="descr">We’ve all found ourselves stuck in this conversation too many times a day (especially those of us who indulge in second dinner). uPick is a multi-player game designed to pick for you!

            <h2>THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND UPICK: </h2>
            <p class="">uPick is specifically designed to take the indecisiveness out of decision making. While we were brainstorming our approach to the issue of the never-ending conversation [fig. 1], we replayed the times we’ve had the conversation IRL and reflected on why we all didn’t know where to eat. I then tried to catch myself when I habitually responded “I don’t know,” observed my in-the-moment thoughts, and found that my mind immediately flooded with an overwhelming amount of options, causing it to freeze like an overheating hard drive.

        <div class="p-text tech-proc">
                <h2>SO HERE, WE BEGIN… </h2>
                Technical Process 
                The first layer of filtering down these options works behind the scenes- uPick is programmed to randomize a list of 10 different cuisines before the game starts. 
                
                Meanwhile, up to 4 players enter the game via Google Firebase. Then, the list of 10 cuisines are revealed on screen.

        <div class="p-text the-game">
                <h2>THE GAME</h2>
                The game itself is straightforward. Each player takes turns to eliminate one cuisine from the list until there is only one left. 
                
                <h2>THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND UPICK pt.2:</h2>
                As I continued to agonize over the root cause of nobody knowing where to eat, I discovered that the answer was hidden in the conversation all along. We all don’t know where to eat; but, we all knew exactly where we DID NOT want to eat.

                <h2>& YOUR DESTINATION WILL BE…</h2>
                Once the players confirm the winning cuisine, uPick works its magic by hitting the Google Places API. The players allow the app to use their location, then uPick returns a list of restaurants filtered according to winning cuisine in the form of a map on screen. From there, it’s just like Yelp. The players click around until they find a suitable restaurant; the game ends.
            ends.

            EPILOGUE
            In further develoment, I would like to add in an extra layer of user filtering before the map displays the
            results and allow them to select their price range or rating range. More importantly, I’d like to program a
            technical filter that not only randomizes the list of generated cuisines but generates the list based on
            cuisines near them (for example, if you are in an area with much more eastern food but, say, no Filipino or
            Indian food within a certain mile radius, uPick automatically eliminates it from the list of cuisines that
            it is randomizing from. I would also like to give the users an option to play the game with cuisines or with
            restaurants, if they are in a location without an extended array of different types of food.
