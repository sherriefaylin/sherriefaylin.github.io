                <h2 class="subtitle">PHILOSOPHY</h2>
                It’s 2019- considering the impact of social media and the fact that politics has flooded into affecting
                our lives more directly than ever, it’s nearly impossible to stay politically ignorant.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a team, we started our process by reflecting on the root of our personal political perspectives, and
                how we developed them over time. It wasn’t a surprise when we all found ourselves <span class="squiggle">running in circles in
                our respective echo chambers.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                While this isn’t necessarily a problem, it’s a type of ignorance. Unless you happen to be particularly
                interested in politics, most everyone naturally defaults to a perspective that may never change.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, social media is built to feed you what they know you want to see, which makes sense of
                course. However, politically, it solidifies our opinions and what we believe is the “right” perspective
                as we continue to hone our politically awareness.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="squiggle">Untrending is designed to crack open that door of your echo chamber, or even just show you that there is
                another door and see a story from the other side.</span>
                <br>
                <br>

        <div class="p-text design-process">
            <h2 class="subtitle">DESIGN</h2>
            <p>As I was going through my first rounds of design research by studying the layouts and interfaces of my
                go-to news outlets, it didn’t take long for me to recognize that it was a misguided approach to
                designing Untrending. I realized that Untrending isn’t a newspaper- <span class="squiggle">it’s more like an Instagram filter
                for your newspaper.</span> So, for this app, I felt the importance of stripping it down to spotlight its main
                purpose: <span class="squiggle">the perspective function.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                So, I kept the elements on the web page to a minimum, and designed Untrending as a dynamic <span class="squiggle">single page
                application.</span>
                <br>

                <br>

                The MVP of the app is coded with <mark>HTML, Javascript, Express, mySQL2, Sequelize, Passport Google

                <br>
                <br>

        <div class="p-text algorithm">

            <h2 class="subtitle">ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p class="p-text">When a user creates their account, they will select their position on the political spectrum. Their
                <span class="p-text squiggle">position will be translated into a number from 1-10</span> (1 = liberal, 10 = conservative) which will become
                the origin variable to which the rest of the application will be calculated accordingly.</p>

         
                <img id="spectrum-gif" width="500px" src="assets/untrending/spectrum.gif" alt="spectrum gif">
                <br>
                <p class="p-text">
                Once the user enters, they will see the top trending headlines that are filtered loosely to what they
                are comfortable seeing.
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, if the user ranked themselves as an extreme liberal, they will see articles from outlets
                with a liberal bias. </p>

            <h4 class="sub-subtitle">HOW A NEWS OUTLET'S POSITION IS DETERMINED</h4>
            <p class="p-text"> <span class="p-text squiggle">Most major news outlets have a clear media bias, so we ranked those on the same scale of 1-10.</span> If a
                particular outlet didn’t have an obvious position, we ranked it slightly more ambiguously but to our
                best judgement after thorough research, like a 4-6 out of 10. </p>
        </div>

        <div class=" main-function">

            <h2 class="subtitle">FUNCTION</h2>
          
                <p class="squiggle p-text">Here’s the gold.</p>
                <br>
                <br>  <p class="p-text">
                Instead of scratching the surface and ranking each article from left to right, we wanted to delve
                into creating an app that truly worked to each user’s specific perspective.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, we wrote an algorithm that <span class="p-text squiggle">shows the user articles based on how similar or different it is to
                their selected political position.</span>
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

  <div class="p-text">
            <h4 class="sub-subtitle">EQUATION</h4>
          
           
               
                <p>The equation is simple.</p>

  </div>

            
            <br>
            <p class="p-text equation">
                Each article is assigned a number equal to the number that its source outlet is ranked.
                <br>
                <br>
                We take that number, and subtract it from the user’s assigned number, and then take the
                absolute value of the result.
                <br>
                <br>
                The result is then translated back to the user interface as a red bar to indicate how different the
                article’s perspective is to the user’s perspective.

            <h2 class="subtitle">FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</h2>

            <h4 class="sub-subtitle">SMALL</h4>
            <p>We’d like to add a simple like or dislike function on each article and store it into our database to
                mold your perspective as it grows from using Untrending. </p>

            <h4 class="sub-subtitle">MEDIUM</h4>

            <p>We’re calculating our algorithm based on a linear spectrum at the moment, but we would like to deepen
                our accuracy by expanding our system to a four quadrant graph as most political spectrums are. </p>

            <h4 class="sub-subtitle">LARGE</h4>

            <p>As the United States continues to become more and more diverse as a nation, it’s difficult for those
                who immigrate or come from a different ethnic background to engage in US politics, yet it affects
                them equally if not more than it does the American rooted. Perhaps starting by translating and
                transcribing articles from English news stories into different languages, it would be revolutionary
                to allow these disconnected communities a window to see into our world as we see it. </p>
