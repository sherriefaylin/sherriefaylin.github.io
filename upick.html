                <p class="descr">We’ve all found ourselves stuck in this conversation too many times a day (especially
                    those of us who indulge in second dinner). uPick is a multi-player game designed to pick for you!
                </p>

        <div class="p-text psychology">
         
            <p class="">uPick is specifically designed to take the indecisiveness out of decision making. While we were
                brainstorming our approach to the issue of the never-ending conversation [fig. 1], we replayed the times
                we’ve had the conversation IRL and reflected on why we all didn’t know where to eat. I then tried to
                catch myself when I habitually responded “I don’t know,” observed my in-the-moment thoughts, and found
                that my mind immediately flooded with an overwhelming amount of options, causing it to freeze like an
                overheating hard drive.

        <div class="p-text tech-proc">
            <h2 class="subtitle">SO HERE, WE BEGIN… </h2>



            Technical Process
            The first layer of filtering down these options works behind the scenes- uPick is programmed to randomize a
            list of 10 different cuisines before the game starts.

            <div class="p-text tech-proc">


            Meanwhile, up to 4 players enter the game via Google Firebase. Then, the list of 10 cuisines are revealed on
            screen.

        <div class="p-text the-game">
            <h2 class="subtitle">THE GAME</h2>
            The game itself is straightforward. Each player takes turns to eliminate one cuisine from the list until
            there is only one left.

            <h2 class="subtitle">THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND UPICK pt.2:</h2>
            As I continued to agonize over the root cause of nobody knowing where to eat, I discovered that the answer
            was hidden in the conversation all along. We all don’t know where to eat; but, we all knew exactly where we
            DID NOT want to eat.

            Once the players confirm the winning cuisine, uPick works its magic by hitting the Google Places API. The
            players allow the app to use their location, then uPick returns a list of restaurants filtered according to
            winning cuisine in the form of a map on screen. From there, it’s just like Yelp. The players click around
            until they find a suitable restaurant; the game ends.
            ends.

        <!-- <div class="p-text epilogue">

            EPILOGUE
            In further develoment, I would like to add in an extra layer of user filtering before the map displays the
            results and allow them to select their price range or rating range. More importantly, I’d like to program a
            technical filter that not only randomizes the list of generated cuisines but generates the list based on
            cuisines near them (for example, if you are in an area with much more eastern food but, say, no Filipino or
            Indian food within a certain mile radius, uPick automatically eliminates it from the list of cuisines that
            it is randomizing from. I would also like to give the users an option to play the game with cuisines or with
            restaurants, if they are in a location without an extended array of different types of food.
